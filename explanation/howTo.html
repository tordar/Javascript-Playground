            Feynman and the difference between knowing the name of something, and knowing something</h2>
        <p>I started working on this website in an effort to showcase all the different Javascript I’ve been learning
            lately. However, sometimes we find ourselves just accepting what we learn because we “see that it works”,
            and we aren’t actually able to explain what it is that we are doing. I am currently about 6 months into
            learning programming, and as I find myself learning more and more abstract subjects, this is a trap I feel
            is easy to fall into.</p>
        <p>Physicist Richard Feynman was strongly critical of this phenomenon. He argued that we often talk in
            fact-deficient, obscure generalities, in a way of hiding the fact that we don’t actually know what we’re
            talking about. To test wether we know what we are actually talking about, or doing, Richard Feynman
            developed a technique.</p>
        <p><strong>There are four steps to the Feynman Technique:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Choose a concept you want to learn about.</li>
            <li>Pretend you are teaching it to a student in grade 6.</li>
            <li>Identify gaps in your explanation; Go back to the source material, to better understand it.</li>
            <li>Review and simplify (optional)</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="what-is-javascript">What is JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is a high-level programming language. Which means that it has a high level of abstraction, from
            the computer hardware. You can imagine that at the very core of computing, you have programming languages
            that are meant to communicate directly with the hardware. JavaScript, Python, and other languages are
            written with actual easy-to-read statements. Take this example describing if a person is old enough to
            enter.</p>
        <pre class=" language-javascript"><code class="prism  language-javascript"><span class="token keyword">if</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>person <span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token number">18</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span>
        console<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">log</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Allowed to enter"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span>
        <span class="token keyword">else</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
        console<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">log</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Not old enough"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span>
        <span class="token punctuation">}</span>
        </code></pre>
        <p>This is relatively easy to understand, and is close to human language. A low-level language is harder to
            learn
            and is closer to directly communicating with the computer in binary code (essentially just ones and zeros).
            High-level languages are more inefficient, because they don’t fully utilise the computers memory. Languages
            like JavaScript need to be “compiled” by the computer to function, and essentially gets translated down to
            binary code, otherwise known as “machine code”. Low-level languages on the other hand need to become
            disassembled for us to understand them.</p>
        <p>JavaScript in particular is useful when we want to add interactivity to websites, or create web based
            applications, some of which I have attempted to create on this website. All the updated code for this
            website can be found on <a href="https://github.com/tordar/Javascript-Playground">the GitHub repo</a>,
            including the excerpts I have included here.
        </p>

        <h2 id="get-new-quote">Get new quote</h2>
        <p>Built into the homepage, the first button on the website generates a hardcoded quote that gets included into
            an empty div element on the main HTML file. By creating an onClick function, the div element will include
            one of the quotes I included in the JavaScript file, as an object. The script identifies the button, and
            when it gets clicked, it randomises a number which is the length of the quotes object, before using the
            innerHTML method to change the website.</p>
        <script class='code' src="https://gist.github.com/tordar/ec0bb0dfeebc35c25898cd2e868625a9.js"></script>

        <h2 id="remove-the-line">Remove the line</h2>
        <p>Incredibly easy, and pretty stupid really. querySelector method to identify the button, getElementById to
            find the horizontal line. Simply remove it from the website, and add an alert half a second later that tells
            you it’s removed. Finally, call the function, so it can execute when the website it run.</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/tordar/57c27e352dfd0bbf2e402de0610b98e7.js"></script>

        <h2 id="get-new-picture">Get new picture</h2>
        <p>This was an absolute nightmare to get through… It shouldn’t have been, and it was extremely discouraging at
            times, but eventually it worked. I thought I could do something similar as with the quotes. Just make an
            object of the image files I had included in a folder, but it was far from as easy. I eventually ended up
            having to use JavaScript’s new Array() function, in which you can define the content of each of the elements
            within the array. Besides that, the actual function works pretty much the same as with the quotes, with a
            few tweaks. This could have definitely have been made more efficient and in a better way. For example, by
            externally hosting the images, which would make the website load quicker, and probably have made for cleaner
            code as well.</p>
