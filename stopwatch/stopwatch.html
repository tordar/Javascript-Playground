                The point of making this was to get practice with object oriented programming.
                OOP is a programming paradigm, which focuses on reusable code, where you create objects
                with methods and properties. This stopwatch contains a few different methods, like start,
                stop, reset. The properties are mainly the start time, end time and duration.
                To see how I made this, go to the source code on GitHub (link on homepage).
